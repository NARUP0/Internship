# Task 11 – Phishing Attack Simulation & Detection

## Objective
To understand phishing attacks, simulate a controlled phishing scenario for learning, and study detection and prevention techniques.

## Tools Used
- Conceptual phishing templates (educational)
- Email analysis techniques
- Security awareness resources

## Work Done
- Studied phishing attack types
- Analyzed phishing email structure
- Identified common phishing red flags
- Learned how phishing simulations track user responses
- Documented prevention methods

## Key Learnings
- Phishing is one of the most dangerous social engineering attacks
- Users are often the weakest security link
- Awareness and MFA greatly reduce risk

## Disclaimer
All phishing simulations were conceptual and performed only for educational purposes in a controlled environment.
