# Task 07 – Web Application Vulnerability Testing


## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to understand common web application vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10 and perform basic vulnerability testing such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on a deliberately vulnerable web application.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environment
- **Target Application:** OWASP Juice Shop
- **Testing Method:** Manual testing using browser
- **Tools Suggested:** Burp Suite Community 

---

## 🔍 Vulnerabilities Tested


## 1️⃣ SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass)

### 🔴 Vulnerability Name
SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass)

### 🔴 Vulnerable Component
Login functionality of OWASP Juice Shop

### 🔴 Payload Used
' OR 1=1--

### 🔴 Description
SQL Injection occurs when user input is directly included in SQL queries without proper validation. In this case, the login form accepted malicious SQL input, allowing authentication to be bypassed without a valid username or password.

### 🔴 Result
Successfully logged into the application without valid credentials.

### 🔴 Impact
- Authentication bypass
- Unauthorized access to user accounts
- Potential data exposure or modification

### 🛡 Mitigation
- Use parameterized queries (prepared statements)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Avoid direct concatenation of user input into SQL queries

## 2️⃣ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### 🔴 Vulnerability Name
Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS)

### 🔴 Vulnerable Component
Search functionality of OWASP Juice Shop

### 🔴 Payload Used
<script>alert('XSS')</script>

### 🔴 Description
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) occurs when an application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code. In this case, injected JavaScript was executed in the user’s browser through the search feature.

### 🔴 Result
A JavaScript alert popup was successfully triggered, confirming XSS vulnerability.

### 🔴 Impact
- Execution of malicious scripts in user browser
- Session hijacking
- Phishing and defacement attacks

### 🛡 Mitigation
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Encode output properly
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

---

## 🧠 Observations
- The application was vulnerable to basic SQL Injection and XSS attacks.
- Manual testing was sufficient to identify critical vulnerabilities.
- Public Juice Shop instances may become unstable after injection attempts, indicating poor error handling.

## ✅ Final Outcome
This task provided hands-on experience in identifying common web application vulnerabilities. SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting were successfully exploited, reinforcing the importance of secure coding practices and adherence to OWASP Top 10 security guidelines.
