# Task 04: Password Security & Authentication Analysis

## Overview
This task focuses on understanding how passwords are stored, attacked, and protected in modern systems. It covers password hashing techniques, common attack methods, and best practices for secure authentication.

---

## Topics Covered
- Hashing vs Encryption
- Common hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, bcrypt)
- Password hash generation
- Cracking weak hashes using online hash identifiers and wordlists
- Dictionary attack vs brute force attack
- Reasons why weak passwords fail
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Strong authentication best practices

---

## Practical Analysis
- Generated MD5 and SHA-1 hashes for sample passwords
- Identified hash types using online hash identifier tools
- Demonstrated cracking of weak hashes using common password wordlists
- Analyzed why fast hashing algorithms are insecure for password storage

---

## Key Learnings
- Passwords should be stored using hashing, not encryption
- MD5 and SHA-1 are weak and can be cracked easily
- bcrypt is more secure due to salting and computational cost
- Weak passwords are vulnerable to dictionary and brute force attacks
- MFA significantly improves account security

## Outcome
This task provided a strong foundation in password security concepts, common attack techniques, and modern authentication defenses.
