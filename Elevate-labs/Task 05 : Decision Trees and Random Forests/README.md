# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Description:
This task involved learning tree-based models using the Heart Disease Dataset.

### Steps Performed:
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier and visualized it
- Controlled overfitting using max_depth
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier
- Compared model accuracies
- Interpreted feature importances
- Evaluated the model using 5-fold cross-validation

### Libraries Used:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

### Dataset:
Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle

## Accuracy:
- Decision Tree (pruned): ~X%
- Random Forest: ~Y%
- Cross-validation avg accuracy: 99.7%
